# 3D-model-by-using-a-Differentiable-Image-Parameterization.
Style transfer from a textured 3D model and a style image onto a new texture for the 3D model by using a Differentiable Image Parameterization.

This notebook uses Lucid to implement style transfer from a textured 3D model and a style image onto a new texture for the 3D model by using a Differentiable Image Parameterization.
